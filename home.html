        <p>This art piece was one I made with respect to the theme of kids toys. It plays with the paranoia of robots and AI taking over our world one day. Most specifically the creature in the art piece is a 'Furby'. They are very well known to be "creepy", however I find that they are quite cute. I think that people just need to lay off of the sterotypical creepy robot toy comes to life and is watching you, and just enjoy the goofy looking toy... </p>
