        <h3>A little more about me:</h3>
        <img id="portrait" src="portrait.jpg">
        <p>My name is Claudia and I dabble a little here and there in the arts. <br>I started back when I was in kindergarten, when I was jealous of my sister's artistic abilities, much like how I was jealous of everything about her. I remember specifically seeing a collage she did of a european kingfisher, and from then on I thought of it as a competition.<br></p>
        <h3>Why did I create this website? </h3><p>Since then I would like to say I've overtaken her just a little, since then, but that doesn't change my drive to compete with her. <br><br>I decided to create this website for my major project in computer science, because around 4 years ago, my sister did the very same. She however used java, which I ended up not having enough time for, but mark my words, I will work on this afterwards too, and I will get it up to her standards.<br>When I had to think about the function of my website, I struggled for a while, but at the time I was submitting my art portfolio to OCADU and it was quite the hustle(got accepted;)), as I had to upload each photo individually and write a little paragraph with a maximum letter count. It took me over 3 hours just to do that and then to upload my 30 sketchbook pages. And so, how convenient would it be to just send a link to my portfolio. They wouldn't have accepted it and this isn't accessible on the internet, but still. It would just be cool.</p>
        <h3>My plans:</h3> <p>So what are my intentions for this project? It started off as a project that I would finish and hand in and be proud of, but as I type, I truly do believe it would be cool to take it an extra step further during my free time. I'm not entirely sure how it will turn out, but considering I'm going into computer science for university, it surely wouldn't hurt would it?
