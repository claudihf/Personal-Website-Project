        <h3><b>Rise Of Robots</b></h3>
        <p>This art piece was one I made with respect to the theme of kids toys. It plays with the paranoia of robots and AI taking over our world one day. Most specifically the creature in the art piece is a 'Furby'. They are very well known to be "creepy", however I find that they are quite cute. I think that people just need to lay off of the sterotypical creepy robot toy comes to life and is watching you, and just enjoy the goofy looking toy.<br><b>Materials Used:</b> Sharpie on paper, Fabric cut out, White out. (MultiMedia) </p>


        <img id="teletubbies" src="Teletubbies.jpg">
        <h3><b>Teletubbies</b></h3>
        <p>This art piece is one that also follows the series of the theme kids toys. I decided to interpret the theme a little astray into kids shows. I feel like the teletubbies is a great source of nostalgia for many, and although I don't feel that much as an 05' baby that grew up without a TV, I thought it would be ironic to put something so innocent into a dark and adulish scene. I mostly built it as I went, and as much as it is almost comical, I found my perspective on society having a great influence on this piece. I think that seeing my friends from the age of 14 smoking weed and drinking alcohol, and then not soon after taking benadryl pills to get a high off of them, and them being so non-cholant about it at the time, makes me feel that despite its overexagerrated nature of the piece, it has a great sense of reality. <br><b>Materials Used:</b> Sharpie, fine-line black felt tip pen.</p>


        <img id="DoorKnob1" src="DoorknobPainted.jpg">
        <h3><b>Door Knob 1</b></h3>
        <p>This art piece was one I made with respect to a theme of an object that is repeatedly reflected in different art methods. One factor being scale and another being the medium, I made this one as a medium size that is painted. I chose an "unnatural" colour of blue and painted the background wood with colours I believed would compliment the blue. The reference image I used was off of a random magazine selling door knobs. I especially liked the fancy details on it, and wanted to show my ability of portraying values. <br><b>Materials used:</b> Acrylic paint. I originally sketched with a pencil crayon.</p>

        <img id="DoorKnob2" src="DoorKnobBurned.jpg">
        <h3><b>Door Knob 2</b></h3>
        <p>This art piece is within the same series of the theme of the same object the door knob. In this one I had completely free range on scale and medium, so long as it was different from previous pieces. I had seen youtube videos long ago back in the 7th grade of a man using a wood burner to draw an intricate design. It had been his first time trying it, and it was so satisfying for me to watch. I decided to try it out, since wood grain was the background for my previous pieces. However I made the sad assumption that heating up a needle would do the job. It did not. I then had to figure out a different method. I tried my 3D printing pen, because if it can melt plastic, surely it would burn wood right? Wrong. I eventually settled on burning the wood and then scraping off the burnt bits. This worked mmuch better than the other methods, and so I carried it out. <br><b>Materials Used:</b> Wood, lighter, sharp metal stick.</p>


        <img id="Stalker" src="Stalker.jpg">
        <h3><b>Stalker</b></h3>
        <p>This art piece is one that I was inspired to do by my friend. Let me give you the run down of this story. She had talked to this guy who is bald from alopecia, and he apparently liked her. She had realized a misunderstanding and one thing led to another, and she warded him off. However you have to understand her type in men is men who are considered "losers". Afterwards she soon realized that he could be classified as her type. She would then slowly obsess about him and everything about him "as a joke". Me, witnessing all of this, could see that her camera roll was filled with him, she would beg me to request him on his social media just to see his face, and once tried to get into my old account in which I followed him, without me knowing. Now I have boundaries, and despite her crossing it a few times, she is still my friend. Giving that I wanted to do a party setting for this assignment I had in class, and not being creative enough to do different styles for each person, I based this piece on her obsession. To this day she is in the distance collecting information about him. <br><b>Materials Used:</b> Watercolour paper, watercolour, saran wrap.</p>
